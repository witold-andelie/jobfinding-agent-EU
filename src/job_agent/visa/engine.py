"""Compute visa feasibility for a (candidate, job) pair.

Design principles:
- Visa sponsorship is OPTIONAL. The engine never rejects a job merely because the
  posting is silent about sponsorship; ``VisaSignal.unknown`` is the common case.
- The only ``red`` outcomes are genuine blockers: the posting explicitly excludes
  non-EU candidates, or the candidate has no realistic legal route (e.g. non-EU,
  no local degree, in a quota-bound non-EU-Blue-Card country like Switzerland).
- Holding a LOCAL degree is the strongest positive lever and can remove the need
  for employer sponsorship altogether.
