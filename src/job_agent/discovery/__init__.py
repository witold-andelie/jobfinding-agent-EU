"""Company-discovery layer — *which* companies to monitor, and which ATS they use.

Pluggable strategies behind one ``CompanyDiscoverer`` protocol so a client can run
either a narrow query (specific country + industry) or a broad sweep:

- ``AtsSearchDiscoverer`` — search ATS domains to find companies ACTIVELY hiring
                            (the real discovery engine: no company names needed).
- ``SeedDiscoverer``      — curated lists (fastest, highest precision).
- ``AtsDetectDiscoverer`` — fingerprint a known company's site for its ATS + handle.
- ``RegistryDiscoverer``  — national business-register open data (widest, lowest yield).

All return ``CompanyTarget`` objects that the Layer-2 ATS adapters can fetch.
